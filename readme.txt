Copyright 2021 Chris Vintsanis

READ THIS BEFORE USING HQES!

This only works with a Gmail account. Also, you need to enable access to less
secure app on your Google account

The program is not perfect, but stay tuned for upcoming releases

If you find any bugs or have a question, please contact me!*

-v3 CHANGE LOG

This is a big release!

First of all, you can now select the number of emails you can read

Secondly, you can save your credentials so you don't have to enter
them all the time


ATTENTION:
The saved credentials are saved in the program location and are stored
in a plain text file, so it is much secure. However, in release 3.1
I will try to encrypt the file!


-TODO
My next goals are a little bit compicated, but I'll try to let you
know when a message was not sent for whatever reason. Also, the
interface for reading will be much more friendly! Plus the credentials
safety problem will be fixed!

*if for some reason you want an older version, you can always contact me too
